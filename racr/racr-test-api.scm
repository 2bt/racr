 ; Function returning two functions that can be used to (1) prepare and (2) perform tests about attribute reevaluation. Such tests are
 ; usefule to ensure that only certain attribute instances must be reevaluated after a rewrite whereas others are not influenced. The first
 ; returned function is used to prepare attribute equations for reevaluation testing. The equation of any attribute to test must be adapted by
 ; using the preparation function. The second function returned is used to test if attribute instances are reevaluated or if their value
 ; already is cached. For that purpose, the test function expects an arbitrary long sequence of attribute names and AST nodes. The respective
 ; attribute instances are the ones that must be reevaluated; the value of any other prepared instance must already be computed. If this is not
 ; the case, the test function throws an exception.
