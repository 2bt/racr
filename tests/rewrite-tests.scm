; The following rewrite tests verify, that only attributes influenced by rewrites are flushed. For that purpose we maintain for
; every attribute instance an evaluation-counter which states how often the instance has been evaluated. The value of instances
; is the value of their respective evaluation counter. To simulate dependencies to other nodes and attribute instances, attribute
; equations contain respective AST accesses. Given such a setting, incremental attribute evaluation can be tested by
; simply comparing the value of attribute instances to their expected number of evaluations.
