; Unit tests for RACR's rewrite interface. The purpose of the rewrite tests is to verify, that only
; attributes influenced by rewrites are flushed. For that purpose we maintain for every attribute-location
; an evaluation-counter which states how often the attribute-location has been evaluated (i.e., how often
; the equations of equally named attributes at the respective location have been applied). The value
; computed by the application of an attribute's equation just is its evaluation-counter. Dependencies to other
; nodes and attributes are achieved as usual by calling the respective node or attribute. Given such a setting,
; rewrites and required attribute dependency and cache maintainance can be easily tested by simply comparing
; every attribute's value to the expected number of evaluations after performing a rewrite.
