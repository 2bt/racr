 ; Syntax definition which eases the specification of attributes by:
 ;  1) Permitting the specification of arbitrary many definitions for a certain attribute for different contexts without the need to repeat
 ;     the attribute name several times
 ;  2) Automatic quoting of attribute names (thus, the given name must be an ordinary identifier)
 ;  3) Automatic quoting of non-terminals and context-names (thus, contexts must be ordinary identifiers)
 ;  4) Optional caching and circularity information (by default caching is enabled and attribute definitions are non-circular)
 ;  5) Context-names of synthesized attribute definitions can be left
 ; Note, that (3) prohibits the specification of contexts using positions within productions. For details about attribute
 ; specifications see "specify-attribute".

 ; Function for the construction of proper attributed, rewriteable derivation fragments. Given a RACR specification, the name of a non-terminal
 ; to construct (i.e., an AST rule to apply) and a list of children, the function constructs and returns an AST fragment, whose root node's type
 ; and children are the given ones. Thereby, it is checked, that (1) the given children fit into the AST fragment to construct, (2) enough and
 ; not to many children are given and (3) inherited attribute instances introduced for children are shadowed by equally named synthesized attributes
 ; the children already have. In case of any violation an exception is thrown. Additionally, an exception is thrown, if attributes of any of the
 ; given children are in evaluation.
